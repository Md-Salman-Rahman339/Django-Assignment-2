    <h4>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const:</h4>

    <div>
        Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
        {
            let x = 2;
        }
         x can NOT be used outside the block

   <h4> Tell us the use cases of null and undefined:</h4>

    <div>
        <br>
        
            In simple terms, null is when we have an empty box on purpose, and undefined is when we have a box, but we haven't decided what to put in it or forgot to put something in it. Both are ways of saying "there's nothing meaningful here," but they're used in slightly different situations.

        <h4>What do you mean by REST API?</h4>

        <br>
        <div>
            So, a REST API is like the waiter (REST) bringing us the menu (API) and taking our order. In the digital world, it's a way for different software systems to communicate and share information.
